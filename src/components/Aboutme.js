                    I am an art school dropout and later studied Northamerican studies and French with a focus on literature and for the past ten years have been working 
                    as a radio host, freelance speaker, museum educator, writer and interpreter.

                    After Covid my main income that from museums was just gone from one day to another, but it also gave me the final time and motivation to work on a 
                    walking tour that I had been thinking about offering each time I walked passed the park and the eclectic mix of hideous functional 50`s architecture, 
                    the gorgeous Bauhaus buildings from the 20s, the royal Rococo leftovers of the
                </p>

                    If you read a biography about a writer you probably realized that writing and walking goes hand in hand. Hemingway was a big walker, so were Charles
                    Dickens, Henry David Thoreau, Ernest Hemingway, Kate Chopin, Ralph Waldo Emerson and also contemporary writers like Delphine de Vigan chugs in a goodâ€¦ miles
                     a day. I still love writing and aim to do It every day but in the tradition of the big writers I feel like it should be combined with walking. What 
                     better idea then to offer a walking tour at this special place?
