                        <strong>The tour encompasses 300 years of German history, with special focus on world war 2 and the wild 70s when Icons of music and popular 
                        culture like <em>David Bowie</em>, <em>Iggy Pop</em> or <em>Christiane F</em>. ran the streets of <em>Schöneberg</em> looking for inspiration, 
                        fame, drugs and destruction. We will discuss a few prominent figures in German literature such as <em>Heinrich von Kleist</em> and <em>ETA 
                        Hoffmann</em> and how they tie into the history of the park. But the area has been playing a role in very recent history as well. The <em>
                        Palasseum</em> seen on uncountable album covers and music videos by German Rap artists- Once a symbol for social decay-today a prestigious piece 
                        of real estate under protection.</strong>

                        <strong>Kleistpark</strong> is hard to beat in Berlin, when it comes to places with more history per m². And we are talking Berlin here, a city 
                        that breathes history. It encompasses over 300 years of German history, architecture and literature. <strong>Heinrich von Kleist</strong> was born 
                        roughly 30 years after the most popular and overrated writer in German history: <strong>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</strong>. Born into a wealthy 
                        family, healthy Goethe never suffered in his life and unfortunately this lack of depth mirrors in his novels which have been torturing high school 
                        graduates for centuries. He knew very well that Kleist was much better than him, which is why he never adopted him as a protegé, which he would if 
                        he would really be a lover of language and literature. What he wanted was to become the icon of German intellectuals and he excelled. Nobody knows 
                        Kleist today but 100 years after his tragic suicide this park honored this underrated brilliant and tortured soul.

                        And it is this park that oozes history. The government can decide to rebuild the Berlin palace on museums island all they want, yet all they ever 
                        going to achieve is a simulacrum à la Disneyland but if you want to see the <strong>original leftovers from Frederik`s palace</strong> you can 
                        still see colonnades, which  were put here in the beginning of the 20th century. It is also one of the main hubs of one of the <strong>darkest 
                        chapters of German history:</strong> World War II: <strong>Goebbels infamous sport-palace speech</strong> took place here. A few meters next to 
                        where Sport palace used to be, we will bump into the Kammergericht, highest state court for the city of Berlin. It was here that Freisler executed  
                        <strong> Stauffenberg</strong> and the members of the resistance group <strong>Die weiße Rose</strong>. But the notoriety of the courthouse goes 
                        back to the 18th century when the jurist <strong>ETA Hoffmann</strong> worked here while moonlighting as a writer of gothic horror and fantasy 
                        stories. Whilst barely known in Germany, let alone abroad he is said to be the biggest influence on none other than <strong>Edgar Allen Poe
                        </strong>. Numerous sources have been researching this connection. Nowadays it is still in use today where it deals mainly with acts of terrorism.

                        I will also talk about the wild 70s with David Bowie and Iggy Pop living right next to the park. We will pass by his former apartment where he 
                        produced three of his most defining albums. In order to get there we will walk along Potsdamer straße, a street known to millions of readers all 
                        around the globe. It was here that <strong>Christiane F.</strong> in <strong>“Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo“</strong> (<strong>We children from Zoo 
                        station</strong>) sold her body at the tender age of 13 in order to finance one of the most vile cases of addiction you can read about. The book, 
                        a huge success which spent weeks on the <strong>Spiegel bestseller list</strong> which is basically the German equivalent to the NYT bestseller 
                        list was translated into 18 languages. We can put off <em>Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo</em> as a piece of trashy social porn, that mythologizes and 
                        therefore almost idealizes the Berlin underground in the 70s, its outcasts, their hedonistic lifestyle, those beautiful losers perennially moving 
                        through time to the sound of glam rock and declare it as piece of pulp fiction that solely relies on shock value, in a way that even the most 
                        teenagey Comedian would not get away with anymore. But we can also see it as testimonial of the angsty generation, that lived in constant fear of 
                        a nuclear war waiting to happen. The Socioeconomic class that Christiane F hailed from,  made heroin their drug of choice because they preferred 
                        the mellow calm heroin offered, over alcohol and thus seemingly opposed them diametrically to their parents who beat them up in a drunken stupor. 
                        At least in theory. The irony that none of these generations come from a culture that gave them any tool to deal with the trauma of a <strong>
                        postwar generation</strong> raises questions if that trauma was ever resolved in the following generations.
